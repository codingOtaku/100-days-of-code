# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 4, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Wrote a simple python script to count number of hits taken by top 10K FPL managers..

**Thoughts:** I'm still having trouble using Python for tasks other than simple scripts. But, for now...

### Day 2: January 5, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Added a visualization script to `fantasyHits` using matplotlib.

**Thoughts**: The scatter-plot is basic and frankly a bit ugly. I am sure matplotlib can offer so much more. But, will let it go.

### Day 3: January 6, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Solved [Problem 32](https://projecteuler.net/problem=32) on ProjectEuler.

**Thoughts**: The problem itself was easy. But had to look up many things on Python which is good I guess.

### Day 4: January 7, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Solved [Problem 33](https://projecteuler.net/problem=33) and  [Problem 34](https://projecteuler.net/problem=34) on ProjectEuler.

**Thoughts**: Functions like `gcd` and `factorial` are readily available. Makes life so much easier.

### Day 5: January 8, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Solved [Problem 35](https://projecteuler.net/problem=35) on ProjectEuler.

**Thoughts**: Didn't know about the `all` and `any` functions.

### Day 6: January 9, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Solved [Problem 36](https://projecteuler.net/problem=36) on ProjectEuler.

**Thoughts**: Didn't know set intersections and unions could be done directly. Stuck on 37 though.
